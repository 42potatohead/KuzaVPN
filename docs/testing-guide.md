# VPN Connection Debugging Guide 🔍

## 🎯 **Testing the Fixed VPN Implementation**

### ✅ **What We Fixed:**

1. **Native Module Registration** - Added proper import and registration in MainApplication.kt
2. **Real VPN Status Checking** - Added service status monitoring  
3. **Enhanced VPN Routing** - Improved traffic routing configuration
4. **UI Status Updates** - More frequent status checking (every 1 second)
5. **Better Error Handling** - Enhanced logging and error messages

### 🧪 **How to Test:**

#### **Step 1: Check Native Module Loading**
- After the app loads, you should see logs WITHOUT "Native module not available - development mode"
- Look for native module calls in the console

#### **Step 2: Test VPN Connection**
1. Open the app
2. Tap "Connect" 
3. Grant VPN permission when prompted
4. Watch for these logs:
   ```
   ✅ WireGuard VPN connected!
   🌐 Server: 152.53.146.237:51820
   🔒 All traffic now routing through VPN tunnel
   ```

#### **Step 3: Verify IP Change**
1. Before connecting: Go to `whatismyipaddress.com` and note your IP
2. Connect VPN in the app
3. After connecting: Refresh the IP check website
4. **Your IP should now show a different location** (likely from your VPN server region)

#### **Step 4: UI Status Check**
- Connect button should change to "Disconnect" 
- Status should show "Connected"
- Connection indicator should turn green

### 🔍 **Debugging Commands:**

#### **Check Android Logs:**
```bash
# In a new terminal
adb logcat | grep -E "(KuzaVpn|VPN)"
```

#### **Check VPN Interface:**
```bash
# On Android device (if rooted)
adb shell
ip addr show tun0
```

### 🚨 **Common Issues & Solutions:**

#### **Issue: "Native module not available"**
- **Solution**: Native module import missing - we fixed this in MainApplication.kt

#### **Issue: VPN connects but IP doesn't change**
- **Possible Cause**: VPN routing not working properly
- **Check**: Look for logs showing "All traffic now routing through VPN tunnel"

#### **Issue: Permission denied**
- **Solution**: Make sure to grant VPN permission when Android prompts

#### **Issue: Connection fails**
- **Check**: Your WireGuard server at 152.53.146.237:51820 is accessible
- **Verify**: Server is running and accepting connections

### 📊 **Expected Behavior:**

#### **Successful Connection:**
1. ✅ App prompts for VPN permission
2. ✅ Logs show "WireGuard VPN connected!"
3. ✅ UI shows "Connected" status
4. ✅ Button changes to "Disconnect"
5. ✅ IP address changes when checked online
6. ✅ Android notification shows "Connected to 152.53.146.237:51820"

#### **Successful Traffic Routing:**
- All internet traffic goes through your VPN server
- DNS requests use 1.1.1.1 and 8.8.8.8
- Your public IP shows the VPN server's location
- All apps route through VPN (unless per-app selection is used)

### 🛠️ **If Issues Persist:**

1. **Check server accessibility**: Can you ping 152.53.146.237?
2. **Verify WireGuard config**: Are the keys correct?
3. **Android VPN settings**: Check if other VPNs are interfering
4. **Restart app**: Sometimes a fresh start helps
5. **Check device logs**: Use `adb logcat` for detailed debugging

### 📱 **Real-World Test:**

The ultimate test is:
1. Note your current IP and location
2. Connect VPN in the app  
3. Visit an IP checking website
4. **Your IP should now be different and show the VPN server's location**

If this works, your VPN is successfully routing traffic! 🎉
